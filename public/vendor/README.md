This folder is intended to hold vendor JavaScript used as fallbacks for CDN-hosted libs.

To provide a local copy of Chart.js for offline or blocked environments, download a UMD build of Chart.js (v3.x works with the current app) and save it as `chart.min.js` in this folder.

Example download URL (choose a 3.x UMD build):
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@3.9.1/dist/chart.min.js

If you'd like me to try downloading it automatically, reply and I'll attempt to fetch it into this folder.
